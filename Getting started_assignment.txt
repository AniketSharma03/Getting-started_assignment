1.Why do we start learning a programming language with â€œHello World!?

Sol: Starting with "Hello, World!" provides beginners with a gentle introduction to programming, helping them grasp foundational concepts, set up their environment, and gain confidence as they embark on their coding journey.

2.How is the use of comments and how do you write comments in HTML?

For example:
&lt; represents the less-than symbol <.
&gt; represents the greater-than symbol >.
